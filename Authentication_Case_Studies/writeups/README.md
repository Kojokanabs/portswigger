# Authentication Case Studies

This directory contains application security case studies focused on common authentication failures, including workflow bypasses, enumeration issues, and insufficient brute-force protections.

Each case study analyzes the root cause, exploitation logic, security impact, and secure-by-design mitigations, with emphasis on issues that automated tools often miss.
