# Description 
The appication uses a hidden GraphQL endpoint that is not directly exposed through the UI
Despite limited introspection defenses, the endpoint can still be discovered andabused

# Lab Setup
* Platform: PortSwigger Web and Academy 
* Lab: Finding a hidden GraphQL endpoint
* Target: Hidden GraphQL endpoint 

# Exploitation Steps
1. Analyze application traffic and JavaScript files
2. Identify potential GraphQL endpoint paths
3. Send crafted GraphQL queries to the discovered endpoint
4. Perform administrative actions via the API

# Result 
* Hidden GraphQL endppoints was successfully discovered 
* A User was deleted via unauthorized access 

# Wakness
* Relaince on obscurity to protect sensitive endpoint

# Mitigation
* Do not rely on hidden endpoints for security
* Enforce strong authentication and authorization on all APIs
