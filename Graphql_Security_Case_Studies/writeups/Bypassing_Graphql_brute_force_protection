# Description
The login functionality is implemented using a GraphQL API with rate-limiting protections.
However, the API allows multiple login attempts within a single request by abusing GtaphQL aliases, enabling brute-force attacks despite the limiter.

# Lab Setup
* Platform: PortSwigger Web Security Academy
* Lab: Bypassing GraphQL brute force protections
* Target: GraphQL login mutation
* Goal: Authenticate as a user "carlos"

# Exploitation Steps(Python-based approach)
1.Intercept a login request to identify the GraphQL endpoint
2. Save GraphQL queries to the Burp Suite site map
3. Send the login mutation to Burp Suite Repeater
4. Generate aliased login mutations using a Python script
5. Send the combined mutation to bypass brute-force protection
6. Identify the successful login user 

# Result
* One aliased mutation returned success: true
* Valid credentials for a user were identified 
* Successfully logged in

# Weakness 
* Rate limiting is applied per request, not per operation
* GraphQL aliases allow multiple authentication attempts in single request

# Weakness
* Apply rate limiting per mutation, not per request
* Restrict or disable aliases on sensitive operations
* Add account-based lockout and anomaly detection
* Enforce strict authentication attempt thresholds
