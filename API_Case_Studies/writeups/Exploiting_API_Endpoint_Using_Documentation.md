Exploiting API Endpoint Using Documentation

# Description
The application exposes API documentation that reveals internal endpoints and functionlity not intended for direct user access
By reviewing the documentation, an attacker can identify sensitive API endpoints and interact with them directly, bypassing intended application workflows and authorization controls

# Testing COntext
* Plaftorm: PortSwigger Web Security Academy
* Scenario: Exploiting an API endpoint using documtation
* Target: Undocumented or improperly protected API endpoint

# Exploitation Steps
1 Log in using valid credentials
2 Locate the exposed API  documentation
3 Review the documentation to identify administrative user-management endpoints
4 Identify the API endpint responsible for deleting users
5 Craft a direct API request to delete the user 
6 Send the request and observe that the action is executed successfully

# Security Impact
* Unauthorized execution of adminisrative API actions
* Deleting of arbituary user accounts 
* Privilege escaltion through direct API access
* Compromise of application integrity and access controls

# Root Cause Analysis
* API documentation exposes sensitive administrative endpoints
* Authorization is not enforced consistently on API endpoints
* Administrative actions rely on obscuity rather than access control
* API threat modeling does not include documentation exposure 

# Why Automated Tools Often Miss This
* The vulnerability is logic-based and context-dependent
* Automated scanners do not interpret API documentation
* Exploitation requires correlating documented endpoints with live behavior
* Tools typically do not test privilege boundaries via documentation

# Secure by Design Mitigation
* Restrict access to API documtation in production environments
* Enforce strict role-based authorization on all administrative endpoints
* Separate internal and external APIs
* Apply deny-by-default access controls for sensitive operations
* Treat documentation as part of the application attack surface

# OWASP Mapping 
* OWASP Top 10:A01 - Broken Access COntrol
* OWASP Top 10:API1 - Broken Object level Authorization
